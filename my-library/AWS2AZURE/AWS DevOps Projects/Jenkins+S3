JENKINS CROSS-ACCOUNT DEPLOYMENT

- On the target accounts, create a role with a trusted relationship with the
  account where jenkins is hosted, with least permissions

- on account where jenkins is, modify the role attached to the jenkins server,
  by adding an inline policy, using STS, write -> AssumeRole, then add the ARN
  of the target account.

- To test connection of jenkins;
  - Install plugin aws steps.
  -

- Install the s3 publisher plugin
- manage jenkins > configure system
- Add s3 profile
- use IAM Role


*********************************************************
The AIM here is to create a webhook to always trigger a jenkins job anytime a
change is commit is made to the master branch in github

- Install github integration plugin in jenkins
- Install AWS steps -> S3 publisher
- Configure system -> Add s3 profile -> tick the IAM Role
- create the script-to-bucket-job | freestyle | git project | add repo |
- Build trigger -> GITSCM
- Post build -> Publish s3 artifacts to bucket
- validate
- create a webhook on github
  - payload url: jenkins-server:8080/github-webhook/
