- Create a DevOps account in control tower and add it to the organization
  and single sign on

- Create an s3 bucket in the N.virginia Region

- Create the following roles in the DevOps account
  - Role1: Trusted identity with jenkins aws account with r/w permissions to
           s3 bucket
           Name: DevOps-Jenkins-crossaccount-role

  - Role2: Trusted Identity with All the accounts with r/o permissions to the
           s3 bucket
           Name: DevOps-crossaccount-role

- Create a bucket policy at the bucket level, to give all the accounts access to
  the bucket.

- Test access to the bucket from all the accounts.

- Add the Role1 to the jenkins server's role as an inline policy

**************************** PIPELINE ****************************

S3 - JENKINS Setup

- Manage jenkins -> manage plugins -> install Pipeline AWS Steps

- Blue Ocean SetUp Summary
  - One repo per project
  - Git repos can be re-used in multiple pipelines
  - Makes jenkins IasC

JENKINS - PIPELINE

- This is an automated expression of your process for getting software
  from version control right through to your users and customers.

- Creating a Jenkinsfile and committing it to source control provides a
  number of immediate benefits.

   - Automatically creates a pipeline build process for all branches and
     pull requests.

  - Code review/iteration on the pipeline (along with the remaining source code)

  - Single source of truth for the pipeline, which can be viewed and edited
    by multiple members of the project

PIPELINE CONCEPTS

- Pipeline code defines the entire building, testing and delivery process

- Jenkinsfile can be declarative or scripted

- Node: This is a machine which is part of the jenkins environment and is
  capable of executing a Pipeline

- Stage: defines a conceptually distinct subset of tasks performed through the
  entire Pipeline ( e.g Build, test, and deploy stages ).

- Step: A single task.

Declarative Pipeline

- The pipeline block defines all the work done throughout your entire Pipeline
