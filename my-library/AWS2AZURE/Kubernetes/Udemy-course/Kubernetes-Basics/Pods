****** PODS *****************

THE BIG PICTURE

App -> Dockerfile -> jenkins -> dockerhub -> k8s cluster (Running containers)

- Before we can have the containers deployed to k8s cluster, the containers are
  encapsulated in a k8s object called PODS

- Always remeMBER NPC,

- Node -> Pod -> Containers

- One App container per pod

- Each POD has a unique IP

- At scale, k8s scale up pods not containers, so we can have multiple pods in a node

- Best practice a pod = a app container
   - for multiple containers in  pod, we use ports to expose the containers
   - but the app containers have same ip cos they are in a pod
