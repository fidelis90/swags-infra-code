WHAT IS A DOCKER CONTAINER

Scenario

- a developer working on his machine which is in the dev environment

- the python runtime is python3.8 version

- the dns config is working fine

- the developer pushes the code to the test environment where the servers are
  running python3.6, therefore some dependencies are not working.

- then the code is moved to production, python2.7 and the code crashed


There are two types of developers now..

- The code works on my machine and the dev environment, i don't care about any other nvironment

- It works on my machine, then i will ship the machine and that's how docker was born.


- A container is am atomic, self contained package of software that includes
  everything it needs to run(code, runtime, libraries, packages, etc)

DOCKER IMAGE vs DOCKER CONTAINER

- Docker image or Container image is the package of everything that is needed
  to run(code,;libraries,runtime, dependencies etc)

- when you docker run on the docker/container image then you have a running application
  inside the docker container


************* SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW ***************************

My-App -> Dockerfile -> Docker-Image -> Repository(Dockerhub/ECR) -> Container(K8S Cluster, EKS, K8S on ec2)

VIrtual Machine vs Containers

A VM needs a guest OS to run, so multiple VMs you need to install guest OS on
individual VMs which takes a whole lot of spaces and it takes time to boot

Container doesn't need guest OS to be installed before they can run. which makes it
easy to boot and scale



Back to developer that had a failed application in the prod environment.
- after writing and running the app on his machine with the following runtime
  - python 3.8

- next is to write a Dockerfile to package the app and the environment into a docker image

- Then this image can be deployed and run on any platform(k8s cluster amazon eks)

- The container can run seamlessly in Dev, Test and Prod environment.


BENEFITS OF RUNNING DOCKER CONTAINERS

- Better resource utilizations

- Runs reliably in any environment (linux, windows)

- App isolation

- Containers are lightweight

- Container orchestrastion is solved
