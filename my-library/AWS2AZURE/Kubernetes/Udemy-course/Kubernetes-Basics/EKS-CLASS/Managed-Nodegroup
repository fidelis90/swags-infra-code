- EKS Managed Nodegroups does the following automatically
  - Create and manage ec2 workers for you
  - amazon releases amis with bug fix, security patches for worker nodes
    - Custom ami not supported
  - automated deployment of updated amis with security patches
    - no app downtime
    - no overhead of user managed orchestration
    - auto scaling group is used behind the scenes

- eks managd nodegroup is an autoscaling group and associated ec2 instances that
  are managed by AWS for an eks cluster. each nodegroup uses the amazon linux ami

- amazon makes it easy to update and apply security patches to nodes and as well
  as update them to the latest k8s version

- To create multiple managed nodegroups and have more control over the configuration, a config file can be used.
