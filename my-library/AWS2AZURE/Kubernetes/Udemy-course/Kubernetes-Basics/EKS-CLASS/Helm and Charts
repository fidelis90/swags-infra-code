*********** HELM CHARTS ****************

- This is a package manager for kubernetes
- Helm packages are called charts
- help install and upgrade complex kubernetes applications
- helm packages can be versioned, shared and published
- helm charts can accept input parameter
  - kubectl need template engine to do this

- yum install python | helm install python

- Helm charts are the easiest and quickest way to deploy containers on a k8s cluster
  that are ready to handle production workloads

- when you do helm install chart, it makes all the deployment needed to run the
  application
  - for example, if we need a nginx webserver container deployed inside our eks cluster
  - manually we will have to create the service manifest file and deployment manifest file

  - but with helm chart, we can just do helm install nginx and the deployment is made and even a service is created
    for us. (mostly a loadbalancer service)
