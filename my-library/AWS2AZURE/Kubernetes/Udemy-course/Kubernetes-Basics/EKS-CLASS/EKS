- Elastic kubernetes service

- This service helps manage the control plane of the kubernetes cluster(master nodes)
  - High availability
    - maintain multiple ec2 nodes in multiple AZs
  - Scale control plane if needed
  - Keep etcd up and running
  - Overhead of managing  ec2s
    - AMI rehydration
    - security patching
    - replace failed ec2s
    - orchestration for k8s version upgrade

- EKS Data Nodes
  - Self Managed
     - Can use custom AMI

  - AWS Managed
     - Can't use custom AMI

- AWS Fargate
     -  No worker ec2
     - you define and deploy pods
     - container + serverless

- Running k8s in eks gives integration with multiple aws services
   - iam
   - cloudwatch
   - secrets manager
   - codepipeline
   - elb
   - route-53


HIGH LEVEL FLOW

EKS CLUSTER -> AWS DEPLOYS AND MANAGE MASTER NODES -> CUSTOMER ADDS WORKER NODES
-> Keep using the k8s tools
   - kubectl, prometheis, grafana, splunk, fluentd, fluentbit, cloudhealth, kubecost, jenkins
     , gitlab, and many more

-> when the eks create cluster is executed
  - eksctl deploys a nodegroup stack in cloudformation
  - eksctl deploys a cloudformation stack for the cluster name


EC2 Instance Type and Pod Limit

- Max number of allowed pods depends on ec2 instance type

- Bigger the instance type, more pods
