************** WHAT IS CONTAINER ORCHESTRATOR *******************

- You have created two images of two applications AppA and AppB

- The images are in DockerHUB or ECS

- To run the images, we need a host like Ec2

- For high availabilty of our application, we need to have a mechanism to scale
  the hosts and have the containers running automatically at scale up and have them
  destroyed at scale down.

- since we have multiple hosts, we will need a loadbalancer to route traffic to hosts

- Monitoring and logging of containers and hosts

- Service Discovery and more

- In order to achieve all these container management related tasks, we need an orchestrator engine
  -> Docker swarm
  -> kubernetes
     - Amazon EKS
  -> Apache mesos
  -> AWS ECS 
  -> AWS Fargate
