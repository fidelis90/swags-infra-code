*************** WHAT IS K8S **********************

- This is the container orchestrator engine.

- Running containers are hosted on the NODE (Ec2), Worker nodes host containers

- The master node is the management node, that manages the k8s cluster between
  multiple worker nodes.
  - The master node is the control plane, monitors, plans and schedules nodes


COMPONENTS OF THE CONTROL PLANE IN THE MASTER NODE

- etcd: key value store for critical cluster info

- Kube-scheduler: puts containers to proper nodes

- Control manager

- API server

K8S CLUSTER STATE

- Desired state must be equal to current state

- Manifest file is the configuration file that tells the master node, the desired state of
  the cluster.

COMPONENTS OF THE WORKER NODE

- container runtime engines (docker)

- Kubelet: This is kubernetes agent running on each worker node, that communicates with the master node

- Kubeproxy: network proxy allows communication to your container from inside and outside your cluster
