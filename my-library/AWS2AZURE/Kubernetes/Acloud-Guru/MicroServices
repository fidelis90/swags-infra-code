-> One of the best ways to demonstrate the value of kubernetes
  is in managing microservice applications

-> Microservices are small, independent services that work together to form
   a whole application

-> Many apps are designed in a monolithic architecture, meaning the entire parts of the apps are combined in one
   executable

ADVANTAGES OF USING MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE

-> Scalability: Individual microservice are independently scalable
   - if your search service is undergoing a large amount of load, we can scale up the pods
     hosting the search mciroservice to meet the requirements.

-> Cleaner code: When services are relatively independent, it is easier to make a change
  in one area of the app without breaking things in other areas

-> Reliability: Problems in one area of the app doesn't affect the other areas

-> Variety of tools: Different parts of the app can be built using different tools
   languages and frameworks. The right tool can be used for every job
