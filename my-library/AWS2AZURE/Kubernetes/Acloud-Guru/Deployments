-> Pods are a great way to organize and manage containers

-> we use deployments to spin up multiple pods using replica sets

-> you specify a desired state for a set of pods. THE CLUSTER WILL THEN WORK TO MAINTAIN
   DESIRED STATE

->  deployments are used for scaling

-> used for rolling updates
   - when we want to deploy new version of our application running as containers
    in the pods, we can use deployments to roll out the new version without having to destroy
    and create new pods on the nodes

-> Self -healing: If any pods is destroyed or deleted, deployment creates replaces the pods
   with a new one
