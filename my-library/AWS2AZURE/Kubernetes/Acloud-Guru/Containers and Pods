- Pods are the smallest unit of the k8s model

- Inside of a pod is where a container is running
  - we can have multiple containers running in a pod
  - But usually a pod always have just one container

- A pod will have a unique IP

- Kubernetes schedules pods to run on specific node

- The container runtime on the node now runs the container inside of the pod
