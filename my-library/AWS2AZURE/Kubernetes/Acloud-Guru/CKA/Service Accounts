-> These are accounts used by the container processes within pods to authenticate with the k8s API

-> if pods needs to authenticate with the k8s API, we use service accounts for that

-> a service account object can be created with some yaml

-> we can specify the namespace where we want the serviceaccount to reside

-> we can bind the serviceaccount to a role using a rolebinding.yml file
