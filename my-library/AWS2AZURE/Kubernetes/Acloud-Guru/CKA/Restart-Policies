-> K8s can automatically restart containers when they fail.

-> Restart policies allow you to customize this behaviour by defining when you want
   a pod's containers to be automatically started

-> This is an important component of self-healing applications, which are
   automatically repaired when a problem arises.

-> There are 3 possible values for a pod's restart policy in k8s
  - Always
    - The default restart policy in k8s
    - containers will always be restarted if they stop, even if they completed successfully
    - use this restart policy for apps that should always be running
  - OnFailure
  - Never
