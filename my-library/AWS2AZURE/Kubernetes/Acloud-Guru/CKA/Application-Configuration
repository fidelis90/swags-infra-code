-> when you running apps in k8s, you may want to pass dynamic values to your apps
   at runtime to control how they behave.

-> ConfigMaps: store data in the form of a key-value map. configMap data can be
   passed to your container apps.

-> Secrets: designed to keep sensitive data like password and api keys
   the data in secrets are passed to our containers using
   - environment variables.

-> Configuration Volume: configuration data from configmaps and secrets can also
   be passed to containers in the form of mounted volumes. This will cause the
   configuration data to appear in files available to the container file system.

-> Each top-level key in the configuration data will appear as a file containing
   all keys below that top-level key.


MANAGING CONTAINER RESOURCES

- Resource Requests
  - allow you to define an amount of resources(such as CPU, MEMORY) you expect a container
    to use.

  - The kubernetes scheduler will use resource requests to avoid scheduling pods
    on nodes that do not not have enough available resources
    - cpu is measured in units (1000units = 1cpu)
    - memory is measured in bytes


MONITORING CONTAINER HEALTH

-> Liveness probes
  - automatic detection of container health status
  - customize and automate the process detection
