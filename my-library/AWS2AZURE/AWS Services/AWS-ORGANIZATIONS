# Check Everything about Organizations in Binary and Doctors.com


- It helps to consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that
  you can create and centrally manage

- As an administrator of an organization, you can create accounts in your
  organization and invite existing accounts to join the organization.

- IAM service provides management on only your local aws account but aws organization
  can allow you apply policies to all aws accounts in the organization.



WHAT DO ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS NEED TO SCALE THEIR AWS ACCOUNTS EFFECTIVELY

- Centrally manage policies across accounts

- Easily create new accounts at scale ( for isolation and grouping )

- View charges and usage across accounts

- Automate account creation

- Control AWS service use across accounts

- Consolidate billing and usage reporting



HOW IT WORKS

- You create the organization from one aws account i.e Master Account

- You can join member accounts into the organization i.e member accounts

- grouping the accounts in the organization is called the Organizational units

- The policies you apply to this organizational units and individual member accounts
  are Security Control Policies

- one OU can be a member of another OU but can't be a member of multiple OUs

- one AWS account cannot be a member of multiple OUs

- The number of levels to use is 5 hierrachy

- The scp can be applied at any heirrachy


MORE BENEFITS OF AWS ORGANIZATIONS

- Automate account creation and management, and provision resources with AWS
  CloudFormation Stacksets.

- Maintain a secure environment with policies and management of AWS security \
  services.

- Configure AWS services across multiple accounts


HOW DO I GET STARTED


- First decide which of your AWS accounts will become the management account

- Then create and add member accounts to the organization.

- Model your organizational hierrachy by grouping the member accounts in OUs.

- Create policies ( such as scp or backup policies ) for OUs, accounts, or the
  organization at the root level.

Note: You can initiate the creation of a new organization only from an AWS
account that is not part of another AWS organization.


AWS CONTROL TOWER

AWS CONTROL TOWER

AWS control tower, built on AWS services such as AWS Organizations, offers the
easiest way to set up and govern a new, secure, multi-account AWS environment.


WHAT IS A POLICY

A policy is a document with one or more statements that define the controls that
you want to apply to a group of AWS accounts. AWS Organizations supports the
following policies.

- Backup policies- requires AWS backups on a specified cadence

- Tag policies- defines tag keys and allowed values

- AI services opt-out policies- controls how AI services store or use content

- Service Control Policies (SCPs)- An SCP defines the AWS service actions, such
  as Amazon EC2 RunInstances, that are available

Best Practices

- Monitor activity in the master account using AWS cloudtrail

- Make sure cloudtrail logs on member accounts send their logs to s3 bucket
  on the Master account.

- Do not manage resources in the master account; only use master account to store
  cloudtrail logs from member accounts

- Manage your organization using the principle of "least privilege"

- Use OUs to assign controls.

- Test controls on a single AWS account first


SERVICE CONTROL POLICIES

- we use this policies to manage our organization

- if we want similar level of permissions across multiple account

- at any level of OU that the SCP is applied it takes effect from the start levels
  to the lowest level.
