*****************  CROSS ACCOUNT ACCESS USING IAM ROLE ******************
# Check everything about IAM on work accounts 


There are 2 AWS accounts  ( k12 & k13 )

We want to allow a user (Gopal - Security Auditor) who has his IAM user in k12
to be able to login to k13 and see all the resources available there.

But, he should not be able to create/delete any resource.

Also, we want to ensure that other users in k12 (Komal) should not be able to
login to k13, using the above created IAM role.


SOLUTION

- create a role in ki3 for Gopal (ki2-user)

- when you check the trusted relationship on the role; we see that there is a
  relationship btw k12 and k13, so any user on the k12 can use the role

- To limit the permission to only one user in k12 to use the role, we edit trust
  relationship by putting the arn of the remote user as the principal user of
  role.

- On ki2 account with gopal logged in, check the permissions and roles attached
  check the groups attached.

- We have to give gopal user the role or permission to assume role ( sts )

- on ki3 account, where we created the role. we copy the account ID and Role
  Number

- Paste the account ID and role on the switch role window of gopal account
