************************  SNS ******************************

- Simple notification service

- We can integrate this to many aws services by creating sns topics

- this will create an alarm when an event happens

- event can be setting a threshold on a metric in cloudwatch and alarm triggers a sns topic

- sns topic send notification to email or slack or microsoft teams


*************** SLACK notification ***********************

- Ec2 SERVER configured to send logs cloudwatch

- Cloudwatch threshold on Metrics like CPUutilization

- Threshold alarm triggers sns topic

- sns topic sends notification to Lambda function

- Lambda function sends to slack


CONCEPT OF WEBHOOKS

- We use this to trigger events

- same way we configure a webhook on github by adding the token for jenkins
  so jenkins can automatically build the codes in a repository whenever there
  is a change pushed to the repository

- same way we create a webhook on slack

- Google create an app on slack; Activate incoming webhook

Incoming webhooks are a simple wya to post messages from external sources (Lambda Function)
into slack. They make use of a normal http request with a JSON payload.



********************** WORKFLOW OF SENDING CLOUDWATCH ALARM TO SLACK **************

- create sns topic

- attach the sns topic to the alarm on cloudwatch

- create a lambda function to convert and send sns message to slack by using webhook
