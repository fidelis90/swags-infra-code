*************** RESOLVER *********************

-> When you create a VPC, R53 resolver automatically answers DNS queries for
   local amazon VPC domain names for ec2 instances

-> A Route 53 Resolver maps to a DNS server that runs on a reserved IP address for the VPC network range
   plus 2. For example, the DNS Server on a 10.0.0.0/16 network is located at 10.0.0.2
