- Managed Network File system

- Used by linux systems

- Multiple ec2 instances can connect

- Lifecycle management can be configured to move files stored that are not accessed
  in along time to EFS IA storage class

- You can configure encryption at rest and in transit
  - Encryption can only be created at the time of creation

- Storage classes
  - Frequently Accessed : Most used / Default
  - Infrequently Accessed

- encryption is enabled by default

THROUGHPUT MODES

- Bursting modes
  - default mode
  - scales as your filesystem grows
  - supports priodic bursting to cater for peaks

- PROVISIONED THROUGHPUT
  - Optionally define the throughput that you want
  - for apps that consistently need high performance

- All efs fd can burst upto 100Mib/s

- The larger the file system the greater the bursting

METERED THROUGHPUT

- A blend of read and write request
- read and write is 1:3 ratio


AZ AND EFS

- If you are using one-zone storage class for efs filesystem, then you can only create
  one mount target in the same az as your efs filesystem

- any ec instance in a different az that has efs mounted will incur charges

- Standard storage class for efs will give high availability
