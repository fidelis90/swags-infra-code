- manage multiple aws accounts in one place

- centrally manage policies across multiple aws accouns

- controls access to aws services

- automate account creation and management

- consolidate billing across aws accounts: single payment method

root -> organizational units -> aws accounts

- service control policy can be attached to users, OU or single aws account

- You can integrate organiations with sso to enable single sign-on to multiple acconts
  using active directory, and customize permissions based on job roles

- accounts within organizations can share resources such as aws transit gateways,
  vpc subnets, route 53 resolver rules, and many more using Resource Access Manager

- integrates with guard duty and resource access manager, firewall manager sso and securityhub


SERVICE CONTROL POLICIES

- Policies created within organizations to control access to accounts and services

- By default scp uses a block list strategy, however scps can be created for allow list statements

Allow list
This will allow access to all resources under ecs and cloudwatch service and block other services
{
  "version":
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ecs:*",
        "cloudwatch:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

Block List
This will allow access to all services except dynamodb

{
  "version":
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowAllActions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "*",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
    "Sid": "DenyDynamoDB",
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": "dynamodb:*",
    "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}


SCP INHERITANCE

- imagine a root account has a scp attached ( allows permissions a b and c )

- the root contains an OU to which is attacheed a second scp ( allows permissions c d and e )

- because the scp attached to the root doesn't allow d and e no OU or accounts in the org can use them

- because the Ou's scp doesn't allow a and b, the ou and every child ou and account attached
 will not use a and b

SECURING MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS USING CONTROL TOWER AND organizations

- Control tower is a service used to create, configure and manage multiple aws accounts securely
  through automating ongoing policy management and guardrails

- uses aws organiations to craete the acounts and apply guardrails and utilize consolidated billings

- multi account framework

- Control Tower Terminologies
   - Landing zones: a framework for creating a multi-account architecture within AWS to configure
      default accounts, account structure and network and security layouts

    - Account factory: is a account template which helps provision new accounts with pre-approved
      account configurations

    - Guardrails: rules which provide governance within aws environment. guardrails
      are applied to OU and the accounts within them.

       - Preventative guardrails: prvents policy violations through enforcement
         via Cloudformation and service control policies

       - Detective guardrails: Detect policy violations and alerts in the dashboard
         through AWS config rules.
