EC2 IMAGE BUILDER 

-> Creates amis for ec2 instances

-> test and validate images

-> automates the process of creating and maintaining your images

-> when software updates are available, image builder can automatically create a
   new image, run validation tests on the new image, and make it available to the
   AWS regions of your choice.

   Image builder allows you to share your AMIs with other AWS accounts that you own

STEPS TO IMPLEMENT EC2 IMAGE BUILDER

- Provide a base OS e.g amazon linux 2

- provide the software to install e.g Node.js, python, latest security updates

- Run test on new ami

- distribute the image to the regions of your choice

TERMINOLOGIES

- IMAGE PIPELINE: Defines the configuration and end-end process of building images

- IMAGE RECIPE: Creates a recipe for each image, which can be shared, version controlled
  and re-used

 source image: amazon linux 2
 build components: apache tomcat


LAB
- Create iam role
  - EC2InstanceProfileForImageBuilder
  - AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore
- create image pipeline
- execute the pipeline
- view the image
