-> Elastic Block store

-> storage volumes that can be attached to your ec2 instance

-> You can create a file system, run a database, new operating system and so on

-> Highly scalable: automatically replicated within a single AZ to protect against hardware failures

-> Scalable

TYPES OF EBS

-> GP2: General purpose SSD(Solid State Drive)
  - Good for boot volumes
  - Good for development and test
  - up to 16k iops per volume and 99.9% durability

-> Provisioned IOPS io1
  - Up TO 64000 IOPS 50 IOPS per Gib
  - designed for IOPS intensive apps like databases

-> Provisioned io2
  - Latest generation
  - cost same
  - Higher durability and more IOPS
  - 500 IOPS per Gib

-> Throughput Optimized HDD(Hard Disk Drive)
  - low cost HDD VOLUME
  - Baseline throughput 40MB per TB
  - Ability to burst up to 250 MB per TB
  - For frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads
  - Big Data, data warehouses, ETL and log processing
  - Cannot be a boot volume

-> Cold HDD (SC1)
  - Lowest cost option 
  - performance not a factor

EXAM TIPS
-> Highly available
-> know the difference in types
