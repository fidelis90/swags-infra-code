CLOUDWATCH METRICS FOR ELB

We generate traffic then cloudwatch can gather the metrics

-> HealthyHostCount
-> UnhealthyHostCount
-> RequestCount
-> TargetResponseTime
-> HTTP status codes


ELB ACCESS LOGS

-> capture information relating to the incoming requests to your ELB

-> It saves the access logs to a backend s3 bucket
