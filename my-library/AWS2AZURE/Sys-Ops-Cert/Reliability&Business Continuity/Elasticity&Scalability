Elasticity

- stretching and retracting our infrastructure based on demand

- allows to pay as you go

- short term

- Autoscaling

SCALABILITY

- scale out the infrastructure

- long term



- Scalability is building your infrastructure to meet demand

- Elasticity VS Scalability
  - EC2
    - Configure auto scaling to increase and decrease the number of ec2 instances
    - increase the instance sizes, use reserved instances

  - DynamoDB
    - Increase / decrease the IOPS based on the traffic spikes
    - unlimited amount of storage( auto scaling is enabled by default)

  - RDS
    - Can't scale on demand
    - Can increase the instance size or add to the number of instances

  - Aurora
    - Autoscale up or don to meet varying demand on the database
    - Modify the instance type and scale out with additional read replicas
