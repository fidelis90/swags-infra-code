- a set of directions for scaling your resources

- scaling strategy

- ECS: adjusts ecs tasks and services in response to load variations

- Aurora: adjusts the number of read replicas in the aurora DB cluster



TROUBLESHOOTING AUTOSCALING

- make sure auto scaling group exists
- make sure the autoscaling service is enabled in th account
- make sure AS config is working


VERTICAL vs HORIZONTAL SCALING

- Vertical SCALING
  - Increasing machine/ system capacity
  - disk, storage, cpu and memory

- Horizontal scaling
  - Adding instances or nodes
  - adding loadbalancers
  - Using auto scaling groups
  - Making the application Multi AZ


- VERTICAL && HORIZONTAL IN SERVICES

- EC2
