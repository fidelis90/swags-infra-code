- read only copies of database

- read replica operates as a DB instance that allows only read-only connections

- applications can connect to a read replica just as they would connect to any DB instance

- amazon rds replicates all source DB in the source db instance

- use read replica for scaling beyond i/o capacity of a single db instance

- use read replica when a scheduled maintenance period and source db instance is unavailable

- for business reporting queries

CREATING READ REPLICAS

- when you create a new read replica

- aws takes a snapshot of your source database

- MULTI AZ enabled
  - YES: the snapshot will be of secondary database and no downtime on your source db

  - NO: the snapshot will be of your primary db, and can cause downtime for 1 minute

-  when a new read replica is created, you can connect to it nusing a new endpoint dns address

- you can have up to 5 read replicas of all open sorce rds db mysql postgresql mariadb and sql server

- you can have read replicas in all regions for all engines

- replication is asynchronous only not synchronous

- you can have read replica from rr

- db snapshots and automated backups can't be taken from rr

- read replicas are for high availability while Multi AZ is for disaster recovery
