- This is a monitoring service to monitor the health and performance of your AWS
  resources, as well as the applications you run on AWS, and in your own data center.

- What can cloudwatch monitor
  - Compute
    - ec2 instances
    - asg
    - elb
    - route 53 health checks
    - lambda

  - Storage and content delivery
    - ebs volumes
    - storage gateways
    - cloudfront

  - Databases and Analytics
    - DynamoDB tables
    - ElastiCache nodes
    - RDS instances
    - Redshift
    - Elastic Map Reduce

  - Other
    - sns topics
    - sqs queues
    - API gateway
    - Estimated AWS charges

- Cloudwatch agent

- Default ec2 host metrics [CNDS]
  - CPUUtilization
  - Network
  - DiskUtil
  - Status check

- You can retrieve data from terminated instance

- Operating system level Metrics
  - by default ec2 doesn't send any os metrics to cloudwatch
  - You need to install cloudwatch agent on the ec2 instance to send os level metrics
    to cloudwatch
  - Memory usage, processes, amount of free disk space, CPU idle time

- By default ec2 send metrics to cloudwatch every 5mins


CREATING CLOUDWATCH DASHBOARDS

- launch ec2 instance
- create a custom dashboard
- add some widgets
- create dashboards to view metrics that are important to you


CLOUDWATCH LOGS

- Centralized logs
  - app logs
  - system logs
  - aws services

- View, search and filter

- Notifications

- Log events: event message and time stamp

- Log stream: sequence of log events, e.g apache logs from a specific host

- Log group: group log streams together, no limit to th number of log streams in a log group


CLOUDWATCH METRIC FILTER

- Create a lambda function: This will automatically create a log group in cloudwatch
  so lambda can send the logs to cloudwatch

- Test: test the lamda function and may send log events to the log group

- Create a metric filter; to alert if any error appear in the log

- we use metric filter at log group level

- we use it to recieve alerts for specific errors

CLOUDWATCH LOG INSIGHTS

- Bespoke query language

- Query and filter the logs directly

- Generate visualizations, e.g bar graph, line graph or pie chart

- create a basic lambda function

- Test the function; generate logs events to the log group

NOTIFICATIONS FROM CLOUDWATCH

- alarms: this monitor your metrics in cloudwatch

- cloudwatch integrates with SNS to send email notifications.

DEMO: CREATE CLOUDWATCH ALARMS

- Configure CW alarm to trigger if cpu exceeds 90% for 1 min
- integrate with sns topic to send email
- run the stress command for cpu load on ec2 instance
