All these predefined actions in systems manager can be used by aws config


- PressGaney has a requirement that all ec2 instance should only use Amazon linux 2 ami

- We create a rule aws config to always detect any instance using another ami

- We create a role: MyAutomationRole

- We need to configure trust policy on the role btw systems manager and aws config, so they can assume
  the role

- We need to attach the policy AmazonSSMAutomationRole to the role

- Add another policy "AllowPassRole" which allows the role to be passed to another
  service
