- Eventbridge is all about event-driven architecture. an event is a change in state

- Can be used to schedule events

- can execute rules on a schedule

- Eventbridge and cloudwatch events are the same

- aws config sends an event to eventbridge, a rule is triggered and the sns topic attached
  sends a notification the email SAME as cloudwatch events.
