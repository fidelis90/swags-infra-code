- Used for log analysis

- involves a large amount of data

- gives visibility into the performance and health of IT infra

- Log monitoring: This is the process of collecting the information and alerting
  when a potential issue is involved.

- Log analysis: evaluating the collected data

ARCHITECTURE

- Data input

- Parsing and indexing

- Searching

SPLUNK DEPLOYMENT MODELS

- Departmental deployment
  - 1 slunk enterprise that has the search head/indexer inbuilt
  - up to 10 forwarders
  - appropriate for up to 10 users

- Small enterprise deployment
  - a single search head (splunk enterprise)
  - 2-3 indexers ( seperate splunk enterprise installations )
  - up to 200 forwarders

- Large enterprise deployments
  - search head cluster
  - lots of load balancers
  - Thousands of forwarders


HOW SPLUNK STORES DATA

- When splunk processes raw data, it adds that data to indexes
  - index is a repository for splunk data
  - few built-in index is main, _internal etc

- splunk transforms incoming data into events, and stores it in indexes

- event is a single row of data

- default fields to all events: timestamp, host, source and sourcetype

SPLUNK APPS

- Apps extends splunk's funtionality

- is a collection of config files

- you can get apps from splunkbase.com


FORWARDING AND RECIEVING

Types of forwarders

- Universal forwarders
  - Mostpopular
  - installed on the local machine and can be configured using a deployment server 
  - default ports: 8089 for management and 9997 for indexing

- Forwarders will not work until you configure recieving

































WHY USE SPLUNK

- Monitors aws infra

- uploads and indexes log data from a local pc to splunk directly

Where is the data stored

- The process of transforming data is called indexing

- The processed results are stored as events

- index is the flat file repository for your data

- Events are stored in the index as agroup of files that fall into 2 categories
  - RAW data
  - Index files

MY SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT

- Host is Dev.holyswagger.com vagrant box

- Splunk directory: /opt/splunk

- Splunk service mgt : /opt/splunk/bin/
  - ./splunk enable boot-start
  - ./splunk start
  - ./splunk stop


- i have uploaded the tutorialdata.zip compressed data file

- the file is has been indexed in the splunk platform and events are created


SEARCH APP IN SPLUNK


- app menu: switch btw splunk apps that you have installed

- splunk bar: edit your splunk configuration

- apps bar

- search bar

- Time ranger


SEARCH QUERIES

Retrieve events from the index

- To retrieve events that mention errors or failures, you type the keywords in your search criteria.

- f you use multiple keywords, you must specify Boolean operators such as AND, OR, and NOT.

- for example buttercupgames error is same as buttercupgames AND error
