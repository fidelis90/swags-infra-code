Scenario: We have a fleet of apache webservers that must be configured to serve
the same web content. They all have the tag role: webserver, to identify them

GOAL
To setup a process that verifies if these instances are configured properly all
the time.

STEPS
- We have our ansible codes in version control system like github
- setup a webhook to always run a jenkins job that will push the ansible codes
  to our s3 bucket
- make sure the AWS bucket is accessible to other accounts
- The s3 url should be placed in the source info
   {"path": "url"}
- The path to the playbook
