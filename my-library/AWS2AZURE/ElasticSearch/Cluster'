- The elasticsearch service is used to store massive data like log data collected
  from remote servers or systems

- On those servers we have filebeat installed on them, these agents ingest data
  on to elasticsearch

- We use kibana to analyze and visualize the data.

- This demo cluster has 3 ubuntu servers in the cluster

- The servers are in three different regions of the world for high availability

- All nodes have metricbeats installed

- The configuration file for ES is in the /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml

- The master node is chosen dynamically

- Iptable security needs to be configured in the cluster in order to allow connections
  from nodes in the cluster only and drop everything else.

- Elasticsearch uses port 9200 and 9300

- Documentation on ES-Cluster: https://sbcode.net/grafana/elasticsearch-cluster/


TROUBLESHOOTING CLUSTER TIPS

- If a data node isn't joining the cluster.
  - rm -rf /var/lib/elasticsearch/nodes


INSTALL METRICBEAT on the Nodes

- the config file for metricbeat is /etc/metricbeat/metricbeat.yaml

- metricbeat has a whole lot of modules

- The metricbeat on all servers are pointed to the nodes in the ES cluster

- so if any node in the cluster is down, the data can still be retrieved from
  any other node

- we use grafana or kibana to visualize and analyze the data

- one of the nodes ip is used as endpoint to the cluster
