- This is an opensource search engine

-  Queries are significantly faster with Elasticsearch

- Analyzing logs

- This is not a relational database

- Scale up to thousands of servers

- Accomodates petabytes of data

- This is used for log management.

- Most organizations use Elasticsearch, Logstash and kibana for log management

ELK Setup

- Elasticsearch: This is used to store all the application and monitoring logs

- Logstash: The server component that processes incoming logs and feeds to ES

- Kibana: a web interface for visualizing logs

LOG ANALYSIS PROCESS

Logstash
  - Collection of the logs
  - Cleaning the data

Elasticsearch
  - Stores the logs
  - Conversion into structured form

Kibana
  - Visual Analysis of logs


ELK FLOW

- First the beats attached to remote servers collects the logs and sends to logstash for filteration

- Logstash which is the data pipeline, filters the logs and ships to elasticsearch for storage

- The data in elasticsearch is now indexed and stored, and awaits kibana to come get them for visualization

- Kibana gets the data from Elasticsearch


Features of ELK

- Systems performance monitoring

- Application performance monitoring

- Data visualization
