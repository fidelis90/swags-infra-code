-> This is terraform's way of bootstrapping custom scripts, commands or actions 

-> provisioner is attached to each resource defining the connection method and the
  actions/commands or script to excute

-> 2 types of provisioners
  - creation-time: this run when resource is being created
  - Destroy-time: when resource is deleted

BEST PRACTICES WHEN USING PROVISIONERS

-> use user data in aws
-> terraform can't be tracked in state file
