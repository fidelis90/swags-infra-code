-> You can build your own custom AMI and bundle your software with the image
   - Packer is a great tool for this

-> Boot standardized AMIs, and then install software on it you need
   - Using file uploads
   - Using remote exec
   - Using automation tools like Ansible, chef, puppet

*************** FILE UPLOADS ***************************

-> We use the provisioner module for file uploads
   provisioner "" {
     source =
     destination =
   }

-> This is an easy way to upload a file or a script

-> This can be used in conjuction with remote exec to execute the script

-> The provisioner may use ssh

-> We use connection to override the default ssh
   provisioner "file" {
      source =
      destination =
      connection {
        user = "$(var.instance_username)"
        password = "$(var.instance_password)"
      }
   }

-> Typically in aws we use ssh keypairs to login to instances

-> To use ssh-keypairs
 resource "aws_key_pair" {
   key_name =
   public_key =
 }

-> you use remote-exec to e xecute a script on an instance
   provisioner "remote-exec" {
      inline = [
        "chmod +x /opt/script.sh"
        "/opt/script.sh arguments"
      ]
   }

-> Ec2 stores the public key on the instance  and you store the private key
