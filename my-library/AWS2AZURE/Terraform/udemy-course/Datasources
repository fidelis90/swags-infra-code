- Terraform providers like aws provides datasources

- datasources provides you with dynamic information

- For example there are datasources that
  - list AMIs
  - list availability zones
  - all ip addresses in use by AWS

- Imagine we have a task to create a securitygroup to allow traffic from
  all ips in a particular availability zone.
    - we can use datasources in terraform to get the ips in that region
    - then we use the data in our aws_security_group resource.
