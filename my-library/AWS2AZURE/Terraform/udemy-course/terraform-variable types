************** VARIABLES IN TERRAFFORM **************

-> We use variables to hide secrets
-> We don't want the aws credentials in your repo
-> We put the aws credentials in a seperate file, and we don't commit the file.
-> Use elements for elements that might change
-> Use variables to make it easier to reuse the terraform files
- - vars.tf: the variables we working with
- terraform.tfvars: the values of the variables
- main.tf: the module for the configuration

- you can now have for and for-each loops

- you don't have to specify the variable types bt it is recommended to do so

- Variable Types
   -> String
   -> Number
   -> Bool

- Terraform's complex types
   -> List(type)
   -> Map(type)
   -> Set
   -> object
   -> tuple

- A set is like a list, but it doesn't keep the order you put it in, and can only
  contain unique values.

- A list that has [5,1,1,2] will have [1,2,5] in a set

- Object is like a map, but each element will have a different type

{
   firstname = "John"
   housenumber = "10"
}

- tuple is like a list, but each element has different types

  tuple = [1, "string", false]

- most common types are list and map
