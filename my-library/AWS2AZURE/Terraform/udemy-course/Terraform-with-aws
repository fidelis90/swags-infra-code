-> create a VPC
   - always create instances in the vpc created by terraform
   - split our vpcs into public and private subnets using availability zones
   - 3 main-public-subnets and 3 main-private-subnets
   - we use the public subnets for internet facing instances
   - load balancers will be in the public subnets

-> Spinning EC2 instances inside the VPC
   - create ec2 instances
   - create security groups
     - egress and ingress traffic rules
     - allow all outgoing traffic
   - create the keypair

-> Attaching EBS
   - the t2.micro adds 8g of ebs storage
     - set to be automatically removed when instance terminates
     - you can increase the root volume using root_block_device block under the
       aws_instance resource
   - some instances have local storage on the instance itself
     - this storage is always lost when instance terminates

   - when a new ebs volume is attached to the instance
     - we mount it on /data for example
     - if we terminate the instance, we lose the data cos we have lost the root
       volume
     - solution is userdata

-> USERDATA
   - Used to customize instances at launch
   - prepare the instance to join a cluster
   - execute commands or scripts
   - Mount volumes at launch
   - only useful at creation
