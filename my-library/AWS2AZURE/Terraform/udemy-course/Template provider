- This can help creating customized configuration files

- you can build templates based on variables from terraform resource atributes (e.g a public IP address)

- The result is a string that can be used as a variable in terraform.
   - The string contains a template
   - a config file

- in AWS you can pass commands that needs to be executed when the instance
   starts for the first time

- the template_file data source renders a template from a template string usually loaded from a
  external file

First create template file
#!/bin/bash
echo "database-ip = ${myip}" >> /etc/myapp.conf

data "template_file" "init" {
  template = file(${template/init.tpl})
  vars = {
    myip = aws_instance."web".private_ip
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
   #...

   user_data = data.template_file.init.rendered
}
