- Terraform keeps attributes of all the resources you create
  - for e.g the aws_instance resource has the attribute public_ip

- Those attributes can be queried and outputted

- This can be useful just to output valuable information or to feed information
   to external software.

resource "aws_instance" "tf01" {
   ami =
   key_name =
   instance_type =
}

output "ip" {
  value = aws_instance.tf01.public_ip
}

- You can refer to any attribute by specifying the following elements in your variable
  - The resource type
  - The resource name
  - The attribute name

- You can also use attributes in a script
resource "aws_instance" "tf01" {
   ami =
   key_name =
   instance_type =

   provisioner "local-exec" {
      command = "echo $(aws_resource.tf01.private_ip) >> private_ips.txt"
   }
}

- Useful for instance to start automation scripts after infrastructure provisioning

- You can populate the IP address in an ansible host file
