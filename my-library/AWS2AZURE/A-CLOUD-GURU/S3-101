EXAM TIPS

- S3 is object based
- files can be from 0 - 5 tb
- there is unlimited storage
- files are stored in buckets
- s3 is a universal namespace
- https://acloudguru.s3.amazonaws.com/
- https://acloudguru.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
- not suitable to install an OS
- successful uploads will generate a http 200 status code
- mfa delete on your object
- key: name of the object
- value: data which is a sequence of bytes
- version id: important for versioning
  - versioning is enabled at the bucket level
  - once you enable versioning on a bucket, you can never return to initial state
- metadata: information about the data you are storing
   - automatically created by aws system
   - system defined object metadata
    - user defined object metadata
- Subresources;
  - Access control lists
  - torrents
- when a file is saved it is replicated in 3 other az
- Only the root user can delete any object or bucket
- Storage classes based on their prices from expensive to cheapest
  - S3 Standard
  - S3 IA
  - S3 Intelligent tiering

  - S3 Glacier
  - S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- s3 server access logging is used to track the access request made to a bucket
  - both authorized and unauthorized attempts will be logged
- CRR: Cross region replication is used to copy objects across s3 buckets in other regions
   - CRR is also used for buckets in different aws account (CRR is asynchronous)
   - CRR helps us to change permission on the replicated bucket.
- Restricting Bucket Access:
   - Bucket Policy: Apply across the entire bucket
   - Object Policy: Individual file
   - IAM Policies: Applies to users and groups
- SRR: same region replication
- S3 Pricing Tiers
 - Storage
 - Request
 - Data Transfer
- Encryption in
    - transit: SSL/TLS
    - Rest Server Side: SSE-S3, Keys SSE-KMS, SSE-C
    - Rest Client Side Encryption
- Versioning
    - backup tool
    - once enabled cannot be disabled
    - Integrates with lifecycle rules
    stores all versions of an object
    - MFA delete capability
    - each versions have their individual permissions
    - you can only suspend versioning on a bucket
- Read FAQs before taking the exam
